# **Sklair 0.1.0 🎉**

## Whats next

0.1.0 is the foundation, for now. Coming next will be component nesting, circular dependency detection, dynamic resource hints, full Lua block support, a stable pre/post-build hook system, and finally distribution of sklair via package managers like brew, winget and maybe apt.
