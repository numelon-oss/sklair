# Sklair 0.3.0 👽

Sklair 0.3.0 focuses on stability, tooling, and correctness, especially around build hooks and project configuration with `sklair.json`.

## What changed? 🍉

### Fixed Lua JSON library registration

- The `json` module is now correctly registered in the sandboxed Lua environment
- Hooks relying on JSON encoding/decoding now work as intended

### Formalised `sklair.json` configuration + schema

- JSON Schema is automatically generated now for `sklair.json` (project configuration)
- `$schema` is now included in generated configs so that autocompletion in editors is possible
- Disabled features no longer appear in generated config files as empty JSON objects

### Improved hooks configuration

- `hooks` is now a structured, optional config section
  - This doesn't actually mean anything yet - the type of `hooks` was changed from `string` to `object`, in line with our goal of extending hooks once again with a new HTTP library, but other than that, any fields populated inside this hooks object currently will not affect any builds until 0.4.0.

### Fixed a wrong error message

- When using the `fs` library in hooks, one might be presented with an error message that shows wrong information when an incorrect path prefix is used.
  - Specifically, an error message said that the prefix `temporary` should be used, when in reality the actual prefix is `temp`.

## What's next?

In 0.4.0, what is to be expected is definitely a safe, sandboxed HTTP library for hooks. Additional features may include document-wide compiler directives (as opposed to ones that only work in `<head>`, like now) because of a compiler directive engine, and maybe some component dynamism through logic inside of comments.

In the slightly longer term, what is to be expected is component nesting with circular dependency detection, dynamic resource hints, full Lua block support everywhere, and finally distribution of Sklair via package managers like homebrew, winget, and maybe apt.

In the even longer term, a GitHub action may be created to streamline the building and publishing of Sklair websites onto GitHub pages. But for now, regular GitHub workflows are good enough.
